# ImgBrick

ImgBrick is a software that converts images into "brick-buildable" versions of theirselfs.
To achieve this the input image is scaled down to a lower resolution and the color palette is limited to very few colors.

## Installation
### Linux
Download the .deb File and install it using your package manager.
*Note: Only Debian based distros are currently supported, other distros need to be built manually.*

### Windows
Download the Win10.zip file, extract it and run it using CMD.

## Usage
`imgbrick [path-to-source] [target-resolution-vertical]`

The image gets stored to your current working directory.

For a more detailed explanation use
`imbrick -h` or `imbrick --help`
